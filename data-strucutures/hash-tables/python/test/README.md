# Unit Tests for Simple Hash Table Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the unit test suite for the `hash_table_simple.py` module, which implements a basic hash table for an e-commerce platform's product inventory. The tests ensure the reliability and correctness of hash table operations such as insertion, lookup, update, and removal.

## Test Suite Description
The `TestHashTable` class contains several unit tests for the `HashTable` class. These tests are designed to verify the correct functionality of all hash table methods, focusing on:

- Inserting and retrieving product information.
- Removing product information.
- Updating existing product information.

## Running the Tests
To run the test suite, execute the following command in your terminal:

```shell
python -m unittest test_hash_table_simple.py
```
This command will trigger all the tests defined in the `test_hash_table_simple.py` file.
